# Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)

This directory contains Product Requirements Documents that define what features we're building and why.

## Purpose

PRDs help us:
- **Align** on what problem we're solving
- **Define** success criteria before implementation
- **Document** user needs and use cases
- **Prevent** scope creep during development

## When to Write a PRD

Write a PRD when:
- Starting a new feature
- Making significant changes to existing functionality
- Adding new user-facing capabilities
- Changing workflows or UX

## PRD Format

Use the [prd-template.md](./prd-template.md) to create new PRDs.

## Naming Convention

```
prd-NNN-short-description.md
```

Examples:
- `prd-001-interactive-mode.md`
- `prd-002-cost-tracking.md`
- `prd-003-plugin-system.md`

## Existing PRDs

| Number | Title | Status | Owner | Date |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|------|
| 001 | Interactive Agent Mode | Implemented | - | 2024-08 |

## PRD Lifecycle

```
Draft → Review → Approved → In Progress → Implemented → Done
```

## Tips

- Keep PRDs focused on **what** and **why**, not **how**
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Link to related ADRs and design docs
- Update status as work progresses
